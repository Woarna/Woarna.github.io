		<br><br><p> Hey! My name is Woarna. I'm a university student who's currently majoring in Computer Science with aspirations of getting into Cryptography. I'm a Libyan-American who has lived in both countries for years and like to think I have gained some useful experience from it. My Metaethical position is anti-realist and leaning towards some form of Error Theory, my Normative position is Total Hedonic Act Utilitariansm, and my applied ethic is along the lines of someone like Singer though I'm sure there's some things I disagree about with him. I hold a lot of ethical positions of course but the main ones I talk about are expanding the moral circle to non-human animals, veganism, and effective altruism. If it wasn't obvious I'm also pretty left-wing though I'm not an anarchist or anything like that.<br><br> My hobbies are Philosophy with a focus on Logic (though I do like other branches), Computers, Mathematics, playing oldschool runescape, watching Anime, reading Manga, and just reading in general really. If one were to ask me my favorite philosopher I would say Kripke because of the formal semantic for Modal Logics he developed. I suppose I should also talk about the purpose of this site, I plan on using it to upload Essays I write and just general arguments for philosophical positions I hold. I may also use it as a kind of blog, who knows? Anyways thanks for checking this out!<br><br> If you want to contact me just email woarna@gmail.com or DM my twitter.</p>
